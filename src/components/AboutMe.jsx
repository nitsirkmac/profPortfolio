            <h3>Hi, my name is Krissy Macdonald</h3>
            <p>I am an independent, hard-working developer that elevates my skills with each project I take on. My attention to detail, communication skills and problem solving ability enhance and support my creativity in every project I lead, or support. I possess the highest standards of ethics, compassion, integrity and success in all that I do. My specialty skills include: white glove customer service, direct and indirect sales, internal process and workflow design, process implementation, training and, as required, process redesign and re-implementation. Iâ€™m ready to step into my future and continue to build my brand as an efficient and effective developer that will further boost productivity, profits and positive brand recognition.
